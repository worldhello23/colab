So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited ( ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\\n\\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\\n\\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\\n\\nHow Much Debt Does Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Carry?\\n\\nAs you can see below, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries had US$19.8b of debt at December 2023, down from US$21.2b a year prior. However, it also had US$3.23b in cash, and so its net debt is US$16.6b.\\n\\nHow Strong Is Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' Balance Sheet?\\n\\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries had liabilities of US$12.2b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$23.1b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.23b as well as receivables valued at US$3.41b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$28.7b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\\n\\nThe deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$15.6b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. At the end of the day, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.\\n\\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\\n\\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.8 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 3.3 times. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. On a slightly more positive note, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries grew its EBIT at 19% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Teva Pharmaceutical Industries can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .\\n\\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries recorded free cash flow of 24% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.\\n\\nOur View\\n\\nWe'd go so far as to say Teva Pharmaceutical Industries's level of total liabilities was disappointing. But on the bright side, its EBIT growth rate is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. We're quite clear that we consider Teva Pharmaceutical Industries to be really rather risky, as a result of its balance sheet health. So we're almost as wary of this stock as a hungry kitten is about falling into its owner's fish pond: once bitten, twice shy, as they say. While Teva Pharmaceutical Industries didn't make a statutory profit in the last year, its positive EBIT suggests that profitability might not be far away. .\\n\\nIf you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free .\\n\\nValuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

Nio announced NOMI in 2017 when it unveiled its first production car, the ES8, taking a portmanteau from the English phrase Know Me.\\n\\nPreviously NOMI was mainly used to perform tasks including playing music, navigating, making phone calls, taking photos, and finding battery swap stations.\\n\\nOn March 5, William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of Nio, said in an earnings call that the company will rely on the vehicle's computing power to launch the NOMI GPT based on AI models, which will be able to increase the competitiveness of existing products.\\n\\nOn March 11, Nio began recruiting beta testers for the NOMI GPT with an initial intake of 600 people.\\n\\nThe latest version of NOMI had gone through 132 version iterations and brings more than 2,000 features to users, the company said at the time.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"symbol\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 576,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"BCAN\",\n          \"WMATIC\",\n          \"NTLA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
